# Make sure the -I for Armadillo actually reaches the compiler.
#
# CMake suppresses -I for any directory in CMAKE_CXX_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES,
# i.e. one the compiler is believed to search by itself. That list is probed
# once, when a build tree first detects the compiler, and it picks up CPATH /
# CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH from the environment of that single run. Configure once
# from a shell exporting CPATH=/opt/homebrew/include (a common Homebrew setup)
# and the Armadillo prefix is baked into the cached compiler description; build
# later from a shell without CPATH and CMake still drops the -I while the
# compiler no longer searches there. Configure then reports success and every
# translation unit including <armadillo> dies on "'armadillo' file not found".
#
# Removing the Armadillo prefix from the implicit list forces the -I to be
# emitted. It is a no-op when the directory genuinely is on the compiler's
# default search path, so this stays correct on the clusters too.
#
# Note this file must be include()d from the top-level CMakeLists before any
# add_subdirectory() that builds Armadillo users -- subdirectories take their
# copy of this variable at add_subdirectory() time.
